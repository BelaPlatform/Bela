/**

 *
 * Bela is a hard-real-time, ultra-low latency audio and sensor environment for
 * BeagleBone Black, which works with the BeagleBone Audio Cape or a custom "Bela Cape"
 * which incorporates stereo audio with 8x, 16-bit analog inputs and outputs.
 *
 * Bela is based on the Xenomai real-time Linux extensions (http://xenomai.org) and
 * uses the BeagleBone %PRU subsystem to address the audio and sensor hardware.

 * was taken from. For this function to have any meaning, the Multiplexer Capelet hardware must
 * be attached and it should be enabled by selecting 16, 32 or 64 analog input channels in the
 * command line arguments.
 *
 * Depending on the block size, it may take longer than a single block to scan all multiplexer
 * channels. For this reason, each call to render() may contain only a subset of the available
 * multiplexer channels. This function allows you timing precision by knowing at what frame each
 * multiplexer reading was taken, but it does not guarantee that all channels can be read in
 * any given callback. If you need access to all the multiplexer inputs in every call to render(),
 * use multiplexerAnalogRead() instead.
 *
 * \param context The I/O data structure which is passed by Bela to render().
 * \param frame The analog frame (i.e. the time) whose multiplexer setting should be queried.
 * \return Multiplexer channel setting at the given frame.
