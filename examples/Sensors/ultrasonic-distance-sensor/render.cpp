Measuring distances with ultrasonic sensors
---------------------------

Ultrasonic sensors can detect distances to a high degree of accuracy, even
in many conditions where infrared sensors would not be suitable (e.g.: when natural
light is a problem.
For this example we used the [HC-SR04](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf).

After it receives a short pulse (> 10us) at its TRIGGER input, the module outputs from the
ECHO output a pulse whose length is proportional to the distance of the object that is in
front of the sensor. When a trigger is received the module emits an ultrasonic wave
from its emitter and then receives the signal back in its receiver, measuring the time
difference between the two.

According to the datasheet of this sensor, the following relation stands:
	time[us] / 58 = distance[cm]
The dataseheet recommends a minimum interval of 60ms between triggers, in order to be able to
read the result appropriately.

Bela sends out the TRIGGER event every 2646 samples(60ms) and then waits for a pulse to come
appear on the ECHO pin. The `PulseIn` class is used here to monitor a digital pin for an HIGH
pulse and once the pulse termiantes, it returnes the duration ( in samples ) of the pulse.

The module requires a 5V power supply and its digital inputs and outputs are low at 0V and
HIGH at 5V. Check the pin diagram in the IDE to see where to find the pins you need.
It is important that the 5V ECHO output from the module *is not* connected
straight to Bela's digital inputs, as that would most likely kill the Bela board
(digital I/Os are 3.3V tolerant). You will need to use a passive resistor divider from the
HC-SR04's ECHO output to scale down the voltage before connecting it to the digital input
on `gEchoDigitalInPin`.

On the scope you should see the pulses coming in from the trigger and the distance. The closer
the object, the shorter the pulses. Make sure you set the trigger to "channel 1" (the pulse) and
you set the horizontal zoom appropriately.
