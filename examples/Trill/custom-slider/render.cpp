/**
\example Trill/custom-slider/render.cpp

Defining a custom slider
========================

This example allows you to create a slider from an arbitrary number of pads
which can be in any order.

The order of the pads and their pin numbering is
defined in slider0Pads etc. We can also set the max number of centroid
which will define how many touches can be registered per slider. This
is currently set to 3 meaning that 3 individual touch points can be registered
per sensor.

Each touch has a location and a touch size which equates to how hard the finger
is pushing on the sensor. This example is particularly useful for working with
Trill Flex and Trill Craft. When working with these sensors it always important
to check that the Prescaler and Noisethreshold settings are optimum for your
application. Experiment with different values if you are not getting a reading
or seeing lots of cross talk between the sensors.
