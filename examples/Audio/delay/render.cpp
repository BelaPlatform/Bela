Simple delay
------------

This example demonstrates how to apply a feedback delay with an incorporated low-pass filter to an audio signal.

In order to create a delay effect we need to allocate a buffer (i.e. an array of samples) that holds previous samples.
Every time we output a sample we need to go back in time and retrieve the sample that occurred `n` samples ago, where
`n` is our delay in samples. The buffer allows us to do just this. For every incoming sample we write its value into
the buffer. We use a so-called write pointer (`gDelayBufWritePtr`) in order to keep track of the index of the buffer
we need to write into. This write pointer is incremented on every sample and wrapped back around to 0 when its reached
the last index of the buffer size (this technique is commonly referred to as a `circular buffer` or a `ring buffer`).

We go a bit further by applying feedback and filtering to the delay in order to make the effect more interesting. To
apply feedback to the delay, we take the sample that occurred `gDelayInSamples` ago, multiply it by our
`gDelayFeedbackAmount` parameter and add it to the dry input signal that we will write into the buffer. This way, there
will always be a trace of the previously delayed sample in the output that will slowly fade away over time.

Next, we apply a low-pass filter. We have pre-calculated the coefficients that are required to apply a Butterworth
(or `biquad`) filter, which is expressed as follows: y = a0*x0 + a1*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*y1 + a4*y2, where x0 and x1 are
the previous *input* (i.e. unfiltered) samples and y0 and y1 are the previous *output* (i.e. filtered) samples.
We keep track of these previous input and output samples for each channel using global variables in order to apply
the filter.

Finally we take the processed sample for each channel and write it into the corresponding delay buffer (`gDelayBuffer_l`
and `gDelayBuffer_r`), so that in the future (after `gDelayInSamples` samples) we can retrieve it again! Last but not
least, we read the sample from the buffer that was written `gDelayInSamples` ago and add it to the output.

Note that we have to ways of changing the volume of the delay effect. One way is to change the overall gain using
the `gDelayAmount` parameter: this will immediately raise or lower the volume of the delayed signal. The other option
is to use the `gDelayAmountPre` parameter, which will apply gain to the *input* of the delay line. The advantage of
using this parameter is that when turning down the gain we can let the delay ring out while not letting any new
input into the effect. Conversely, we can introduce the delay effect naturally without fading in previous output
of the effect.
