\example Fundamentals/scope/render.cpp

Oscilloscope in-browser
-----------------------

This example demonstrates the scope feature of the IDE.

The scope is instantiated at the top of the file via `Scope scope;`

In `setup()` we define how many channels the scope should have and the sample
rate that it should run at via `scope.setup(3, context->audioSampleRate)`.

In `render()` we choose what the scope log via `scope.log(out, out2, out3)`.
In this example the scope is logging three sine waves with different phases. To see
the output click on the <b>Open Scope</b> button.

An additional option is to set the trigger of the oscilloscope from within `render()`.
In this example we are triggering the scope when oscillator 1 becomes less than
oscillator 2 via `scope.trigger()`. Note that this functionality only takes effect
when the triggering mode is set to custom in the scope UI.
