Sending from the GUI to Bela
============================

This project is a minimal example on how to send data buffers from p5js to Bela.
Bela (render.cpp) receives a buffer of data from p5js (sketch.js) containing three floats:
two corresponding to slider values and the third one correponding to a button.
These values are then mapped as parameters of an oscillator object. The mapping is:
slider1-->pitch
slider2-->amplitude
button-->play/stop

HOW TO RECEIVE A BUFFER IN BELA
===============================

In order to receive a buffer from the GUI, the type of the buffer and maximum number of values
that it will hold need to be specified in setup:
```
myGUi.setBuffer('f', 3);
```
In this case we are expecting to receive a buffer of floats with a maximum of 3 elements.
This function will return the index of the buffer (which is given automatically based on the order
they are set on). This buffer will have index = 0.
The buffer can then be accessed using this index:
```
DataBuffer& buffer = myGui.getDataBuffer(0);
```
Notice that the Gui::getDataBuffer() method returns a `DataBuffer& `(that is: a
_reference_ to a DataBuffer). You should in turn always be storing the return
value in a `DataBuffer&` variable to minimize copy overhead, and ensure
that it can be used safely from within a real-time context.

And its contents retrieved in the desired format (floats in this case):
	`float* data = buffer.getAsFloat();`
