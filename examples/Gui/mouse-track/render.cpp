/**
 * \example Gui/mouse-track/render.cpp
 *
 * GUI mouse tracker
 * =================
 *
 * New GUI fuctionality for Bela!
 *
 * In this project you can find a sketch.js file which is a p5.js file that is rendered
 * in a browser tab. Click the GUI button (next to the Scope button) in the IDE to see the rendering of this file.
 * 
 * This example receives a buffer of data from the GUI with the X-Y coordinates of the mouse (normalised to the size of the window). The Y axis controls the pitch of an oscillator while the X axis controls L/R panning.
 * In order to receive a buffer from the GUI, the type of the buffer and maximum number of values that it will hold need to be specified in setup:
 * ```
 * myGUi.setBuffer('f', 2);
 * ```
 *
 * In this case we are expecting to receive a buffer of floats with a maximum of 2 elements. 
 * This function will return the index of the buffer (which is given automatically based on the order they are set on).
 * This buffer will have index = 0.
 * The buffer can then be accessed using this index:
 * ```
 * DataBuffer& buffer = myGui.getDataBuffer(0);
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that the Gui::getDataBuffer() method returns a DataBuffer&(that is: a
 * _reference_ to a DataBuffer. You should always be storing the return
 * value in a DataBuffer& variable to minimize copy overhead, and ensure
 * that it can be used safely from within a real-time  context.
 *
 * And its contents retrieved in the desired format (floats in this case): 
 * 	`float* data = buffer.getAsFloat();`
 * 
 * Additionally, two One-pole low pass filters are used to smooth the values read from the GUI and avoid glitches.
 * 
 * If you want to edit sketch.js you can do so in the browser but must write your p5.js code in instance mode.
